File Listing
------------

The following is the tree of the package:

.
├── doc
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── logo-colorex.png
│   │   └── screenshot.png
│   ├── manual.html
│   ├── README
│   └── report.pdf
├── Makefile
└── src
    ├── assignment.cpp
    ├── first.cpp
    └── second.cpp

If the application has been built, the tree is as follows:

.
├── bin
│   ├── assignment.o
│   ├── first.o
│   └── second.o
├── doc
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── logo-colorex.png
│   │   └── screenshot.png

Making from source:
-------------------

To make from source, we require the following:
g++ 4.7+
OpenGL
glut
glui

The project contains three source files:
"first.cpp" and "second.cpp" are just test files for compilation. The main code is in "assignment.cpp".

To make from source, we can do the following:

$ make 
Builds assignment.cpp

$ make assignment
Builds assignment.cpp

$ make first
Builds first.cpp

$ make second
Builds second.cpp

$ make all
Builds all the cpp files.

After building, the object files are stored in the bin/ directory.
To execute main application:
$ ./bin/assignment.o

To clean the project (Remove binaries):
$ make clean
